This Python code uses the Pygame library to create a classic Snake game. 

1. Initialization: Sets up Pygame, defines constants for game parameters (speed, sizes, screen dimensions), and initializes screen and fonts.

2. Collision and Movement: Defines functions to check for collisions and manage the snake’s movement within screen limits.

3. Classes:
   - `Apple`: Represents the food that the snake eats.
   - `Segment`: Represents individual parts of the snake.
   - `Snake`: Manages the snake's segments, movement, growth, and collision detection with itself.

4. Game Functions:
   - `getKey()`: Handles user input for controlling the snake and exiting the game.
   - `endGame()`: Displays a game-over screen and handles restart or exit.
   - `drawScore()` and `drawGameTime()`: Display the current score and elapsed time on the screen.
   - `respawnApple()` and `respawnApples()`: Reposition apples on the screen when eaten.

5. Main Game Loop:
   - Initializes the snake and food.
   - Continuously updates the snake’s position, checks for collisions, handles input, and redraws the screen.
   - Ends the game if the snake collides with itself and allows restarting or exiting.
